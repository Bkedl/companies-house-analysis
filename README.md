## Overview

This project applies SQL and Python-based data analysis to a simulated dataset inspired by UK Companies House and qualitative stakeholder research. Using Jupyter Notebooks, I conducted data cleaning, preparation, and exploratory analysis to assess customer retention, promotional effectiveness, inventory shrinkage, and seasonal sales patterns. Visualisations such as box plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps highlighted correlations and operational pain points. Predictive modelling and statistical testing, including regression and correlation analysis, were used to forecast trends and evaluate markdown strategies. A detailed 200+ page report and supporting notebooks document the full methodology, results, and business recommendations.
