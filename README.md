## Overview

This project is a data-driven exploration of operational and financial trends within UK supermarkets. The work combines interview insights with structured data to assess customer retention, sales performance, theft/shrinkage and markdown impacts. Using Python and modern data analysis techniques, the goal was to derive insights that could support strategic improvements in store operations and profitability.

The dataset is a constructed simulation based on financial and operational trends publicly available through Companies House. It reflects realistic patterns in markdown strategies, customer behaviour and inventory shrinkage common to UK supermarkets. Further details on dataset sourcing can be found in Chapter 3 of the accompanying report.

The project includes both technical analysis and a detailed written report.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Microsoft Excel (for preprocessing and summary validation)
- AI / Google Scholar (for hypothesis support and academic validation)

## What Was Done

- Stakeholder Research: Interviewed a UK supermarket employee to gather real-world operational insights and contextual pain points.
- Data Sourcing: Datasets were constructed from structured public financial data and operational trends identified through Companies House and secondary research (detailed in Chapter 3 of the report).
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Addressed missing values, column inconsistencies and irrelevant records.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualised customer retention, promotional effectiveness, shrinkage patterns and seasonal sales behaviour using a variety of static plots.
- Predictive Modelling & Statistical Testing: Regression models were used to forecast sales trends and assess markdown efficacy. T-tests and correlation analysis supported or refuted working hypotheses.
